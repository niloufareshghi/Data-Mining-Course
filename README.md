## Association Rules Homework
Association rules represent relationships and interdependencies between large sets of data items.
A common example of association rule discovery is "shopping cart analysis". In this process, according to the different items that customers put in their shopping carts, the buying habits and behavior of customers are analyzed, and by identifying the relationship between products, repeating patterns during shopping can be obtained.

In this part of the exercise, I applied the apriori algorithm on the Hypermarket_dataset dataset, which contains people's purchase orders from grocery stores.
